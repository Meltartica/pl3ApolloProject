# Hippopotamus (Hypothesis Testing Calculator)

## Programming Language:
- Python

## Project Description:
- The goal of this project is to develop a program that can perform hypothesis testing for various statistical scenarios. 
- The program should take in user inputs for the statistical data, the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis, the level of significance, and the type of test. 
- The program will handle a range of statistical scenarios, including one-sample tests, two-sample tests, chi-squared tests, and more. 
- Based on these inputs, the program should calculate the test statistic and the p-value and interpret the results.

## Key Features:
- User-friendly interface for inputting statistical data and hypotheses
- Calculation of test statistic and p-value
- Selection of appropriate statistical test based on user input (e.g., t-test, z-test, chi-squared test, etc.)
- Interpretation of results based on user-specified level of significance (e.g., reject or fail to reject null hypothesis)
