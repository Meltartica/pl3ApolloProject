# Hippopotamus (Hypothesis Testing Calculator)

## Programming Language:
- Python

## Python Libraries Used:
- NumPy
- Math
- SciPy
- Colorma (Fore, Back, Style)

## Project Description:
- The goal of this project is to develop a program that can perform hypothesis testing for various statistical scenarios. 
- The program should take in user inputs for the statistical data, the level of significance, and the type of test. 
- The program will handle a range of statistical scenarios, including one-sample tests, two-sample tests, chi-squared tests, and more.
- The program will used the given data to get the scores and critical point then summing up with either rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis.
- Based on these inputs, the program should calculate the test statistic and the p-value and interpret the results.

## Key Features:
- User-friendly interface for inputting statistical data and hypotheses
- Calculation of test statistic and p-value
- Selection of appropriate statistical test based on user input (e.g., t-test, z-test, chi-squared test, etc.)
- Interpretation of results based on user-specified level of significance (e.g., reject or fail to reject null hypothesis)

## Supported Types:
### Single Population
- **Case A**: Single Population Where Sigma is Known or Sample is Large
- **Case B**: Sigma is Unknown or Sample is Small
- **Test for Proportions**: Single Population
- **Variance** For Single Population"

### Two Population
- **Case C**: Two Mean Big Sample Size or Population Stnadard Deviation is Given
- **Case D**: Two Mean Small Sample Size and Population Sample Standard Deviation assumed Equal
- **Case E**: Two Mean Small Sample Size and Population Sample Standard Deviation not Equal
- **Case F**: Paired Observation
- **Test for Proportions**: Two Population
- **Variance** For Two Populations

## Utilized Statistical Distribution Types:
1. Z-Distribution
2. T-Distribution
3. Chi-Square Distribution
4. F-Distribution
